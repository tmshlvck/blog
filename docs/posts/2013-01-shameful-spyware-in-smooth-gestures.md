title: Shameful spyware in Smooth Gestures

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://snarkybrill.blogspot.com/2013/01/shameful-spyware-in-smooth-gestures.html)*.

Once again there was an ugly shameful and disgusting breach of what modern computing with OSS stands for. The Smooth Gestures extension to Chromium / Google Chrome was mucked with spyware which reports all the browsing actions to the creator of the extension.<br />
<br />
Look here:&nbsp;<a href="http://codeonfire.cthru.biz/?p=96">http://codeonfire.cthru.biz/?p=96</a><br />
<br />
I personally used the extension so I was a bit upset when it disappeared from Chrome Market but a bit of googling was enough to wake up. It said: <b><u>What the ****?!</u></b><br />
<br />
Anyway I hunted for some replacement which wasn't that easy... But I have found one: Recognize it for Chrome -&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recognize-it-for-chrome/bclaagbljldlbmihblajinlijckggkea">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recognize-it-for-chrome/bclaagbljldlbmihblajinlijckggkea</a><br />
