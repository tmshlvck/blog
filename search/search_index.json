This was my focus few years ago, I worked as an admin/op in a small hosting company and I was bombarded by SMSes from our home-brewed server/service monitoring system written in Perl. The system has bunch of drawbacks so we decided to replace it by Nagios (3 dot something). It has drawbacks as well, and I would say that even more serious in some cases.</p> <p>I was responsible for the Nagios migration but I am not an op anymore so I have less experience with that. From my point of view, being aware of my limited insight, I can describe some drawbacks in Nagios 3 (= Nagios Core, simply the OSS version you get when apt-get install Nagios3 on top of Debian...).</p> <p>The first one and probably the most severe: The configuration is complicated by nature. In addition Debian forces/strongly suggest some ideas about how you should write the config files. And when you try to do so, you have to read manual which does not give answers to all questions. For example: Are multiple parents in dependency tree of hosts/services in AND, OR or whatever relation? You can find lots of small questions and eventually Google some answers, dig into documentation or whatever, but it takes time. Anyway, writing Nagios configs takes time and one should ask himself: Why? Of course you can use Swiss-made NConf to convert writing config into clicking configs in web interface, but it is not a real improvement. Why can't it be automatic? Let's say the system can auto-discover hosts and test-run all yet-know service tests. If some of tests results to OK, it can suggest that test. It should be able to clone hosts, categorize hosts, make exceptions etc. but on the other hand I prefer text config files over some sophisticated database schema...</p> <p>The another thing is that sending alarms should be smarter than only triggering scripts like send mail to contacts and send messages to pagers or cell phones in modern days. Well, I like the idea of master alarm. I would like to have a possibility to set some alarms as not crucial for business/system operation and have them listed in web interface/reports and alarmed by less aggressive way to ops. I would like to have a possibility to have some threshold for sounding master alarm and then sending this master alarm (once or N-times but not overflowing ops with hundreds of different and probably correlated errors). And I would like to have a permissive and easy to use system, not a system which does not allow to acknowledge all reported errors and when not acknowledged, it bothers by SMSes over and over. I would like the system to accept my input and respect what I want or want not to save, not like Nagios-&gt;Acknowledge-&gt;Error: You have to write a comment. Wtf.? I have major network problem, I want to investigate what is going on and not writing stupid comments, especially in situation I do not know what to say, I just want to stop SMSes from bothering me.</p> <p>I would like to have a monitoring cluster, able to monitor network/servers/services from more locations and give me a overall report. I would like to have a possibility to write own triggers on errors/warnings, to report more complex situations. Let's say that I have a cluster of 10 servers with loadbalancing and I know that 5 servers would be sufficient. I would make sense not to send alarm during nighttime when one of these 10 servers went down. But it make sense to send alarm if only 6 or less servers remains operational. Event more complex situations could be described and it would be nice to set this triggers easily.</p> <p>And I would like to have a overview on my system. I want to see what is going on, what happened in past and write afterwards how did I solved the problem to have op's log and tip for next time.</p> <p>I think that technically it should be relatively easy to run few thousands of test each minute on a decent Intel server. Not speaking about parallelization. Then it comes an idea: We have a paradigm/style/philosophy of test driven development. Why not to have a test driven system operation? I think there are two \"contras\": ComplexNess of configuration and complications with data acquisition and interpretation - i.e. people fears that it would be more complicated to answer a question \"what is broken?\". But I believe that both \"con's\" a only drawbacks of current software.

Basically what can you choose when you want a Linux desktop? Well, of course plenty of things but when you need getting things done and you do not want to play with own xrandr, xkb, xinput\u00a0scripting or with printing, keybindings for multimedia keys etc. you would probably need some desktop environment. And there are quite a lot of such projects (look at Wikipedia). KDE. Gnome3. Xfce, LXDE, Unity to name some.  Well what you can find is that there is a huge hare-core of Gnome3 and Unity. People just hate them because these desktops are everything but useful and intuitive. The both are resembling some of iPad madness and with Unity there are rumors on the web that it is actually designed for tablet computers and its usage on desktop is some sort of side-effect of development in the meantime when Canonical (author of Unity &amp; Ubuntu) is negotiating deals with tablet manufacturers. Pity. In fact these desktops forces you to do things by their ways (different from what we all are used to from previous generations of desktops starting from Win 3.11 up to Gnome 2.32) and they are putting obstacles between you and your productivity apps. And I concur with all these objections against particularly these two desktops.  There is of course KDE. KDE is way long from what is my idea of a decent desktop. I like some aspects of it but it lacks what I need - really fast desktop (with or rather without eye-candy but really fast!), easy-to used virtual desktops, app panel and good application switcher and support for docking/undocking (which means changing screen resolution, switching on/off the LVDS etc. It takes me to the remaining Xfce.  But current stable Xfce (on Debian Wheezy) to be specific is fare from being easy to use. I had to tweak it deeply to become usable. I had 4 most severe problems I had to cope with. NetworkManager (+ NM Applet) was unable to connect to set network. (Solved). There are nasty sounds in different applications set. The most annoying are terminal bell in gnome-terminal and gdm3 greeter sound (turned off easily). Two problems are more complicated and I am still working on them. First is Xfce\u00a0xkb applet which looses it's configuration (I mean set layouts, layout-switcher keyboard shortcut etc.) each and every time you connect or disconnect USB keyboard. Which effectively means it looses the configuration each time you dock or undock your laptop. And the last problem is automatic switching of desktop resolution and putting LVDS to on/off state according to presence of another screen connected via Display Port. I have done some scripting workarounds to switch this semi-automatically but I am not proud of it at all.

Cisco perhaps. Idea is to use IGP, nowadays it is naturally OSPF in most cases, for resolution of the L3 path towards a subnet in question. The subnet itself is terminated on a gateway. Two different gateways to be accurate. One acts as a default gateway, which means that it is active router in HSRP, so it holds \"virtual\" IP address as well as MAC address of the default gateway. It is the address that hosts in the subnet uses in their routing tables and subsequently in their ARP tables.  So far so good. Everything is up and running, one gateway is active, another one passive, both routers are redistributing connected routes to OSPF and both are able to deliver traffic from L3 networks towards clients in the L2 subnet in question.  But wait a moment... How do L3 switches know where to send the traffic over L2? Yes, routing table and ARP resolution. By default the ARP table records timeout is 4 hrs, right?  And how do L2 switches know the port to forward traffic? MAC address table (or switching table, depends on terminology). Timeout for MAC address table? 5 mins.  So what does the passive switch do when no traffic from hosts hits this switch, because it does not have active default GW address and nobody wants to communicate over L2 to it's \"real IP\". Well, obviously the MAC address table cleans out after a while but ARP records stays much much longer (and ARP records are refreshed when some traffic arrives and the L3 switch does not have proper ARP table records).  But... When there is no MAC address table record for the particular MAC on the standby L3 switch, the switch just broadcasts the traffic for that MAC to all ports. And it multiplies in the network further because in case you have prevailing vertical flows in your network it is likely that any other L2 switch in the chain does not know the MAC address either. Except the one which has the destination host connected. So it means you might have huge multiplication of useless traffic if your L3 switch attracts some traffic in OSPF for any subnet which it is standby for it's gateway.  It might several megs or even tens or hundred megs of constant scattered traffic in real life scenario in 1 Gig network.  And what to do to avoid this? Think of the design pattern... Set higher OSPF costs for redistributed routes on the standby router. Simple but effective, huh?</p>","tags":["Networking","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"2014/05/08/2014-05-smokeping-slavery-madness/","title":"Smokeping s\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*y madness","text":"<p>This was originally posted on blogger here.</p> <p>So once again I have been hit by an insane portion of weird, flawed and inherently unreliable design in Smokeping.</p> <p>What the **** is Smokeping? Well, it is an utility for measuring and graphing latency in network. It should be pretty straight-forward to use. You configure IP addresses and names of boxes to monitor and that't it? Well, not so fast... It is a bit poxy because it is Perl after all. You need some modules, you need to have multiple configuration files, you have to configure probes, bind them to targets, modify arguments for probes in target configs etc. There is quite a lot of how-to's for this and in fact it works almost out of box on most distributions.</p> <p>But... The Smokeping beast has also a slave mode. Which means: You have one master that holds configurations and it performs measurements and it generate graphs, everything is the same as in standalone mode. But it also commands slaves to perform the same measurements and report results so the master saves the results to .rrd files and it create graphs.</p> <p>This communication with slaves is performed by CGI in the Smokeping webroot. And here comes the problem: Privileges.</p> <p>When Smokeping runs as a daemon it is executed under smokeping user, at least on Debian. So all files that it stores (on Debian usually these files end up in <code>/var/lib/smokeping</code>) have <code>smokeping:smokeping</code> user and group and privileges <code>644</code>.

So I gave up and sold the Windows-only HP Pavilion X2 laptop to a friend who does not mind this crap OS.</p> <p>And I have new and shining Lenovo Yoga 300-11IBR. It is slightly larger, heavier and has shorter battery life than the HP Pavilion X2 and it has standard 45W power brick while HP had nice tiny tablet charger with USB-C connector. But anyway, Lenovo runs Linux without problems... Well, at least without unbearable problems.</p> <p>Before proceeding further there are some photos:</p> <p></p> <p>And insides:</p> <p></p> <p>There is no fan (sweet) and there is even a place for thin 2.5'' disc, but special bracket and a cable is needed. (I have eMMC version with 64 GB and I am fine with that.)</p> <p>OK, so what's the status with Linux. I tried this puppy with Ubuntu 15.10 and it worked out of box. Touchscreen, graphics, touchpad, camera, power indicator, sound, everything seems to be doing fine. But... I noticed some problems with ACPI after a while: Special keys, like volume + / - (physical), screen brightness + / - (virtual) seems not to be working or working with unpredictable delay. Software applets for manipulating volume and brightness works for me, so it is not a show stopper. And the same observation fits to ACPI events like AC adapter inserted or removed - there is huge delay, like tens of seconds or minute. And the same for LID close event. And the orientation sensor seems not to be supported - there is some ugly error in dmesg that concerns probing it. But I am using the laptop as a laptop so I do not care about the sensor much.</p> <p>But anyway, the ACPI events problem might get solved in some BIOS update or there might be a solution in rewriting DSDT table. I dind't have enough time to dig deeper so far.</p> <p>I am attaching dmesg and dmidecode outputs here.</p>","tags":["Linux","HW","Ubuntu","Linux

Why? Well, the branch ISP applies RPF. Everybody is supposed to apply RPF, because it is the best practice... or something (*). (https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp38)</p> <p>Anyway, the problem is that PBR on its own is apparently not enough. If you just set it up, it does not work. Since it has not been immediately apparent why to be I tried to google questions like \"FortiGate PBR not working\" and I eventually found one \"solution\" but no real answer what is going on here. To me specific, last comment here gives instructions that seems to work:</p> <p>Add a new default route to routing table. The route needs to have same Administrative Distance as the active default route (towards ISP), next-hop is not needed, but the interface is vpn0 and the Priority has to be lower (= higher number) than the real active default route towards the ISP.</p> <p>OK, it works, but why? The official manual nor this is not really helpful and I found few other speculations on Reddit, Stack Overflow and random blogs, but nothing on the sport. So, the answer is...</p> <p>RPF.</p> <p>There is reverse path filtering on the tunnel interface and FortiGates use \"feasible path\" RPF rule by default, which means that with an active default route through the tunnel is enough to provide feasible path, even though the route is de-prioritized (to avoid causing random load-balancing that would very likely lead to random asymmetric routing and therefore random packetloss in this setting). Btw. the AD has to be same as the real static route, otherwise it will not be considered as a feasible path.</p> <p>And another possibility is disabling the RPF with \"src-check disable\", like this:</p> <pre><code>branch # config system interface\n\nbranch (interface) # edit vpn0\n\nbranch (vpn0) # show\nconfig system interface\n    edit \"vpn0\"\n        set vdom \"root\"\n        set allowaccess ping\n        set type tunnel\n        set src-check disable\n        set snmp-index 19\n        config ipv6\n            set ip6-allowaccess ping\n        end\n        set interface \"wan\"\n    next\nend\n</code></pre> <p>(*) On more serious note - mocking BCP 38 is not fair. It is undoubtedly the best community-based and therefore Internet-native solution to great portion of the known cyber-attacks.</p>","tags":["firewall","Networking","FortiGate","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"2024/03/20/2024-20-blog-migration/","title":"Migrating blog from blogger.com to mkdocs and GitHub pages","text":"","tags":["legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"2024/03/20/2024-20-blog-migration/#why","title":"Why?","text":"<p>Simple.
